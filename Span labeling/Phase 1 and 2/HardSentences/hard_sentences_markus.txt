The staff could not have been better and the hotel was not far from the centre.

The people were friendly, but there was often no one at the reception.

The hotel is not nearly as bad as people here make it out to be.

Our stay was anything but pleasant. No care for their customers at all.

Area not too crowded, but still a city feel. Would definitely recommend.

You would be hard pressed finding a worse place than this.
